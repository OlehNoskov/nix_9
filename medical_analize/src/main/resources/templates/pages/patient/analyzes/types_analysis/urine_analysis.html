                            Coprogram is an analysis of intestinal contents.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is used to diagnose various diseases of the gastrointestinal tract: pathology of the
                            liver, stomach, pancreas, duodenum, small and large intestine, gallbladder and biliary
                            tract.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And to assess the results of treatment of diseases of the gastrointestinal tract.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Basically, there are several changes in the contents of the intestine, which can lead to a
                            malfunction in the body:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ☑️ a change in the amount of components that are normally contained in the stool
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            ☑️ biological elements and substances released from the body into the intestinal lumen
                            (erythrocytes, leukocytes, intestinal epithelium)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ☑️ various substances that are formed in the intestinal lumen from metabolic products,
                            tissues and cells of the body (crystals that appear as a result of digestive disorders)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ☑️ microorganisms causing fermentation processes in the intestine (iodophilic flora,
                            yeast-like fungi - developing in case of dysbiosis)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ☑️ foreign inclusions of biological and other origin
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ☑️ they also detect eggs of helminths and protozoa.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And when do you need to take the coprogram?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ❗ With symptoms of any disease of the digestive system: pain in various parts of the
                            abdomen, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation, discoloration of feces, blood in the
                            stool, loss of appetite, weight loss despite satisfactory nutrition, deterioration of skin
                            and hair and nails, yellowness of the skin and / or whites of the eyes, increased gas
                            production.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ✔️ Remember, if you are taking a coprogram, you don’t need to separately donate feces for
                            the study of helminth eggs and protozoa.
