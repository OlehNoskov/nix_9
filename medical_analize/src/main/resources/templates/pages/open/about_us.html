                <b>Rastvorceva Irina Yurievna</b>
            </p>

            <p align="justify"> Doctor of clinical laboratory diagnostics.
                Graduated from the Kharkiv National Medical University (Ukraine) with a degree in laboratory
                diagnostics, in
                the
                past she
                graduated from the Kharkov Humanitarian Pedagogical Academy with a degree in sociology, social
                pedagogy.</p>

            <p align="justify">🔹In the beginning of her work in the department of the clinical diagnostic laboratory,
                she
                was engaged in
                laboratory diagnostics of body systems, after that she was engaged in numerous narrow
                specializations.</p>
            <p align="justify">🔹At the moment I am engaged in hematology, cytology, immunology in laboratory
                medicine.</p>

            <p align="justify">I will explain a little about these directions:</p>
            <p align="justify">💉 Hematology is a department that studies and diagnoses blood diseases (anemia,
                leukemia,
                thrombocytopathy, etc.)
            </p>
            <p align="justify">🔬 Cytology - deals with the diagnosis of diseases at the cellular level. First of all,
                it is
                assessed how much
                the material under study corresponds to the norm and if there are pathological changes, then how much
                pronounced. A bad sign is the identification of atypical cells. Material for cytology is taken from
                almost
                any
                field.
            </p>
            <p align="justify"> 🧬 Immunology - diagnostics of the state of the immune system, immune diseases and
                everything
                related to immunity.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
                I love my job very much, I try to give myself to it with all my heart! And since medicine does not stand
                still,
                and everything is constantly evolving, I also try to keep up with all trends and improve (courses,
                conferences,
                seminars).
