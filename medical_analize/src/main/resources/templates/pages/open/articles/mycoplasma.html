                            Ureaplasma and mycoplasma are small bacteria about which a lot of horror has been said. We
                            hear that as soon as they are identified, they urgently need to be treated! But is it really
                            so? And what methods of laboratory diagnostics should rightfully be used to diagnose and
                            prescribe antibiotic therapy?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In connection with the uncontrolled prescription of drugs over the past 10 years, the number
                            of cases of resistance of microorganisms to treatment has increased dramatically. And when
                            you really need to treat, there is no result🤷‍♀️
                            Why is this happening?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum in 70 - 80% are normal microflora in the
                            genitourinary tract, and are considered conditionally pathogenic microorganisms, as well as
                            staphylococcus, streptococcus, gardnerella, etc.
                            They begin to multiply only when conditions favorable for them are formed (changes in the ph
                            of the vagina, decreased immunity, etc.)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Only Mycoplasma genitalium should be treated if detected by PCR.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It can cause:
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            🔹 miscarriage;
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            🔹 placental dysfunction;
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            🔹 polyhydramnios;
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            🔹 intrauterine infection of the fetus;
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            🔹chronic infection of the urinary system;
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            🔹adnexitis, endometritis, salpingitis;
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            🔹infertility
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The rest of the species only in the presence of symptoms, complaints and results of
                            bacterial sowing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ⚠️If you have a positive PCR, this only means that you have these microorganisms, but this
                            does not mean that they will cause or have caused disease.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the presence of complaints and a positive PCR result, for the purpose of treatment, it is
                            mandatory to measure the Ph of the vagina and submit a sowing tank!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Only if the number of bacteria is increased (titer 10 * 4 CFU / ml and above) and ph is
                            changed accordingly - the culture is divided by sensitivity to antibacterial drugs and only
                            after that the drug is selected and treatment is prescribed, and not like now - "a finger to
                            the sky" 😑
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Sometimes additional studies are prescribed for the presence of other types of infections
                            (chlamydia, Trichomonas, gonorrhea) because the symptoms of diseases can be very similar😔
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And if the doctor is not competent, you will be treated, for example, a harmless ureaplasma
                            and the cause of your complaints is Trichomonas🤷‍♀️
