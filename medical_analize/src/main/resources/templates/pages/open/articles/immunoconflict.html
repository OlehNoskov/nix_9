                            Immunoconflict or Rh conflict - arises due to the incompatibility of the blood group or Rh
                            factor of the mother and the fetus, during organ transplantation or blood transfusion (blood
                            transfusion)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This analysis is used to assess the tension of the immune system and the risk of developing
                            an immunoconflict.
                            The rhesus conflict itself is an aggressive reaction of the body to a foreign object - as he
                            believes, in other words, an autoimmune reaction.

                        <p>
                            These are antibodies that are produced in the mother's blood as a result of contact with
                            other large blood of the fetus and destroy the maternal red blood cells. Hemolysins do not
                            affect the fetus, but after birth, the baby may have severe lingering jaundice.
                        </p>

                            ✔️Autoimmune (Lymphocytotoxic) autoantibodies - aggressive antibodies that are formed in
                            autoimmune diseases.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ✔️Isoimmune Antibodies are produced by the donor or husband to erythrocyte antigens,
                            primarily to the Rh factor, indicating increased sensitivity to the effects of an irritant
                            (Rh factor).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            ✔️ Rh conflict occurs only if the mother has -, and the fetus has + Rh, and what is
                            important, only in subsequent pregnancies, during the primary pregnancy, the Rh conflict
                            develops extremely rarely.
