                            Almost all diseases of the thyroid gland (thyroid gland) begin imperceptibly, without
                            pronounced symptoms. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor the level of hormones in the
                            blood, as well as the state of the thyroid gland in general, which can be assessed using
                            ultrasound.

                        <p>
                            The main indicators for the study of the thyroid gland are:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            üîπthyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) of the pituitary gland, stimulating the formation and
                            secretion of thyroid hormones;
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            üîπthyroid hormone (T4 total) - a stimulator of ‚¨ÜÔ∏è oxygen consumption and tissue metabolism;
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            üîπfree T4 is an important stimulant of protein unification;
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            üîπ–¢3 general - a stimulator of oxygen absorption and a metabolism activator;
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            üîπT3 free - stimulates the absorption of oxygen by tissues and the synthesis of vitamin A in
                            the liver, ‚¨áÔ∏è the concentration of cholesterol in the blood, ‚¨ÜÔ∏è the excretion of calcium,
                            accelerates protein metabolism and much more)

                        <p>
                            üîπAntibodies to thyroglobulin AT-TG: thyroglobulin is a precursor of T3 and T4, it is an
                            iodine-containing protein.
                            Thyroglobulin (TG) is a protein found in thyroid follicles; its concentration in the blood
                            increases in cases of violation of the structure of the thyroid gland itself or accompanied
                            by iodine deficiency;
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ATs to rTTG (antibodies to TSH receptors) can cause ‚¨ÜÔ∏è concentrations of thyroid hormones
                            (T3 and T4) in the blood. It is found in the majority of patients with Graves disease and is
                            used as a marker of this autoimmune disease.

                            Preparation for research:

                        <p>
                            ‚úî The examination is performed in the morning on an empty stomach - at least 8 - 12 hours
                            should elapse between the last meal and blood collection.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ‚úî You should not donate blood after X-ray examinations, physiotherapy procedures
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ‚úî It is necessary to exclude factors influencing the research results: physical stress
                            (running, climbing stairs), emotional arousal
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ‚úî The result may be influenced by the medications taken.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ‚úî Given the changes in blood counts during the day, it is advisable to repeat studies at the
                            same time.

                            ‚úî Different laboratories may use different research methods and units of measurement. In
                            order for the assessment of the results to be correct, it is desirable to conduct research
                            in the same laboratory at the same time.
