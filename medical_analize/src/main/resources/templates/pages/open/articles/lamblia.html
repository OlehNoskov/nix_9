                            As we know, lamblia are the simplest microorganisms that affect the gallbladder and
                            intestines, when ingested with contaminated food, which subsequently cause very serious
                            diseases.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are many methods for determining the presence of giardiasis, but which of them should
                            be used, and which are indicative only in some cases?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ðŸ“Œ The most often prescribed detection of IgM and IgG to lamblima, by ELISA, but!
                            These tests are indicative only if you have an acute phase of the disease, or you just want
                            to know if your body has met with them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since, for example, IgG can show
                        </p>
                        <p>ðŸ”¹ Recently transferred giardiasis.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ðŸ”¹ Carriage of G.lamblia.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That is, having passed this analysis, you and your doctor will simply guess if there is no
                            pronounced clinical picture!
                            In this regard, the ELISA method cannot be used to establish a definitive diagnosis of
                            giardiasis and monitor the effectiveness of therapy.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ðŸ“ŒThe next analysis is feces on lamblia (or duodenal contents), where the detection of cysts
                            is most valuable.
                            The detection of lamblia is greatly influenced by the time of delivery of the material to
                            the laboratory and the beginning of the study, from the moment of collecting the material to
                            the study it should not take more than 2-3 hours, otherwise the lamblia will be destroyed or
                            cysts will be difficult to detect, since they merge with fecal detritus.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ðŸ“ŒOne of the most accurate tests is considered to be the test for the specific, for lamblia,
                            GSA-65 antigen used in Europe.
                            It is based on the use of antibodies to trophozoites or to lamblia antigens. When using this
                            method once, lamblia was detected in 50-70% of patients, and with a threefold analysis in
                            more than 90% of patients.
                            And unlike the determination of ig in the blood, this test allows you to identify the
                            pathogen in the feces, even in the absence of a pronounced immune response.
