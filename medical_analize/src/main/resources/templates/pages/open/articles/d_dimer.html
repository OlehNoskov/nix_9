                            D-dimer is a fragment of a protein that appears during the breakdown of a blood clot, which
                            occurs during blood clotting and is considered a marker of blood clots.

                            Blood clots in blood vessels are found in a number of diseases: varicose, atrial
                            fibrillation, with a complicated course of infectious diseases, complications after surgery
                            and can lead to death.

                            The International Society for Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) has issued guidelines for the
                            use of D-dimer in covid 19 monitoring.

                            ‚ö†Ô∏èA sharp increase in the concentration of D-dimer may indicate the formation of a large
                            number of blood clots in the bloodstream.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But where exactly the thrombus is located, unfortunately, it is impossible to establish from
                            this analysis. A normal D-dimer reading means that the patient does not have an acute form
                            of the disease causing blood clots.

                            of COVID-19, on the 4th day, signs of DIC syndrome (increased thrombus formation) were
                            revealed.

                            D-dimer rate (‚â§250 ng / ml) - may vary depending on the test method and units of measurement.
