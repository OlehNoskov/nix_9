                            Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that exists in two forms, D2 and D3.

                        <p>
                            D3 differs from other vitamins in that it is formed under the skin when exposed to
                            ultraviolet radiation.

                            D2 comes into the body with food and supplements, the largest amount contains:

                        <p>
                            Studies have shown that vitamin D deficiency is widespread throughout the world, but mostly
                            only in those people who do not eat enough foods containing it and spend very little time in
                            the sun.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Vitamin D deficiency can affect the immune system, as this vitamin plays the role of an
                            immunomodulator, strengthening innate immunity by increasing the production and secretion of
                            antimicrobial proteins that increase the protective functions of the body's mucous
                            membranes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Also, a lack of vitamin D plays an important role in the occurrence of both pathology of the
                            skeletal system, and many different socially significant
                            chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, certain
                            cancers, autoimmune diseases, and
                            infectious diseases, and is also associated with increased mortality.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition, a recent WHO study documented the protective effect of vitamin D on respiratory
                            infections.
