                            A heart attack is a necrosis of the heart muscle, due to circulatory disorders.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ‚ö†Ô∏èThis disease is one of the ten most common in the world.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            üîé The main thing in diagnosing a heart attack is its timely detection and differentiation
                            between other diseases that give similar symptoms, but a completely different approach to
                            treatment (pulmonary embolism, syenocardia).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Laboratory tests for suspected myocardial infarction:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            üîªTroponin I is a group of proteins found in the muscle tissue of the heart, and is
                            currently a marker of myocardial damage. With a heart attack, Troponin rises after 4-10
                            hours and can be high up to 2 weeks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But this analysis also has drawbacks, if its quantity is examined at an earlier time (less
                            than 4 hours), it can be normal despite the presence of myocardial infarction, and troponin
                            can also increase with other lesions of the heart muscle (for example, with chronic heart
                            failure, myocarditis, pericarditis, and other diseases with myocardial damage).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            üîªSC MV (Creatine phosphokinase) is one of the forms of an enzyme involved in the energy
                            metabolism of cells, and is a specific indicator of myocardial damage.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The concentration of MC MV increases within 4 - 8 hours from the moment of a heart attack,
                            but it can also remain normal in the first 4 hours even with a heart attack.
                            If the patient has troponin I and CK MB is normal, they speak of a microinfarction, with
                            troponin I and creatine phosphokinase, they speak of an acute heart attack.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            üîªMyoglobin is a protein found in the myocardium and striated muscles. An increase in the
                            amount of myoglobin can be detected in the first 2 hours after the onset of a heart attack.
                            Therefore, myoglobin is the earliest, most sensitive clinical and laboratory marker of
                            myocardial infarction.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            üîªAST and ALT - Myocardial damage is also accompanied by an increase in the concentration of
                            these enzymes in the blood, 6-12 hours after the onset of myocardial necrosis, reaches the
                            highest value after 24-48 hours, and normalizes on the 7th day of illness.
                            Currently used as an additional marker in the diagnosis of heart attack.

                            ‚ùóÔ∏èWhen confirming myocardial infarction, it is recommended to conduct additional studies to
                            identify risk factors contributing to the development of the disease:
